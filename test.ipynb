Instead, use adaptive granularity so each context represents a single coherent idea or a closely related group of ideas.\n",
    "4. Each context must be a single paragraph in plain text only (no markdown, symbols, bullet lists, or extra formatting) and must be comprehensive while not exceeding 1000 words.\n",
    "5. Ensure COMPLETE COVERAGE: every sentence and idea in the input must be captured. Combine closely related sentences or lines into the same context when they form one idea. If the same idea appears multiple times, consolidate and capture it once in a single, comprehensive context that references all occurrences.\n",
    "6. Each context paragraph must be accurate, precise, and sufficiently detailed (one paragraph per context). Avoid splitting one idea across multiple contexts.\n",
    "7. Format the output EXACTLY like this (plain text only, numbered sequentially with no gaps):\n",
    "   CONTEXT_1: [First context paragraph]\n",
    "   CONTEXT_2: [Second context paragraph]\n",
    "   CONTEXT_3: [Third context paragraph]\n",
    "   ...continue until all distinct ideas are covered.\n",
    "8. Do not include any prefatory or trailing text, analysis, comments, metadata, or explanations outside the CONTEXT_n lines. Output only the CONTEXT lines.\n",
    "9. If the input contains ambiguous statements, make a best-effort interpretation and include that interpretation clearly within the relevant context paragraph; do not ask clarifying questions.\n",
    "10. If a single coherent idea requires more than 1000 words, split that idea into the fewest possible contexts while keeping each paragraph coherent and ≤1000 words.\n",
